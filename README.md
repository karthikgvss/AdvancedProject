Advanced Project On Github Report

This Project is aimed to give a snapshot / Report of the issues, pull requests of a Github Organisation. It includes details from all repos of the organisation. 

To execute this, clone this repo and run the Generate_Github_Report.html file to see the seattle testbed issues and pull requests. 

The organisation name can be changed in the Report_Generator.js file to point to any other organisation of your interest other than seattle testbed.
